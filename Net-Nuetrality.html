    <h1> Net-nuetrality by Olwethu Ngubo</h1>
    <h2>Ethical Reflections 3</h2>
    <p>
      <div class= "paragraph">The idea of abolishing the principle of net neutrality is absolutely obnoxious.
  People should be allowed to surf the internet however they want so long as they are paying for it.
  The internet should be accessible and fast to people who need it. Net neutrality should be a basic right
  of the use of the internet, because the internet is for everybody. I say that because the internet has become a
  very important part of the 21st century</div>

 <div class= "paragraph">The fact that Internet Service Providers would only provide a certain number of websites is ridiculous, people
 should not be limited with what they do on the net, because yes the internet can be used for despicable actions,crimes,
  child-pornography, theft, fraud and other horrendous things it can also be used for good and useful things and more
   good than bad is done on the internet. It would not be fair on the web-makers to pay the ISPs for their websites to
    be accessed.</div>

 <div class= "paragraph">I have never come across a website that requires you to pay money in order for you be on it, so making the web-makers
pay to share information with the public is a disagreeable notion. I can understand that they are trying to make
money and have the internet system changed to work like how prepaid television works but the fact still remains;
they are trying to make money.</div>

<div class= "paragraph">The internet is a very important medium in which we express ourselves as the public so if you want to demolish the net,
you would be limiting, in a way, peoples right to freedom of speech. Although some people use their screens as a mask
 they hide behind to commit crimes and say unacceptable things, the internet is still used for more good than bad.</div>
