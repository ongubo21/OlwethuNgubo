<div class="explanation">
  <p>
    In this course, students will learn the fundamental concepts of computer science, including algorithmic design (flow control, memory management, code style), developing for the Internet (web development and design, networking, web hosting and servers), and ethical considerations for people in a digital age. This course teaches students how to analyze and simplify complex problems in order to algorithmically construct elegant solutions.  The languages taught will include (but will not be limited to) HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Assembly.  No prior programming experience is necessary.  Students will work primarily on projects, and the class will contain both software development and writing components.

  <h2 class="subheading">Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    All dates listed on assignments below are the date the assigment is <em>due</em>, at the start of class.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Thursday, July 5th</strong>: Getting started.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Install <a  href="https://atom.io">atom</a>, a text editor
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVStCqO14I">Dr Z's video</a> on setting up a new MacBook.  Don't worry about the <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> stuff, that's specific to the Java programming language, which we won't be using.  But still, watch the whole video, and follow along, making the changes that I make.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up your terminal the way I do in the video.  Make sure you can open up atom on your computer, and make sure it's in your <code>Applications</code> folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          I gave you a handy resource, the "Really Friendly Command Line Intro".  I highly recommend you read it before our first quiz&mdash;that doesn't have to be tonight!
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>


      <strong>Friday, July 6th</strong>: HTML/CSS beginnings
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an extremely simplified version of your portfolio website, with just your name, some organizational stuff (like some <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp">unordered lists</a> or something), a space for your "projects", and a place for "other".  Don't forget to name it (exactly) <code>index.html</code>!
        </li>
        <li>
          Work through <a href="https://github.com/nzufelt/intro_html_css/blob/master/hosting_on_github_pages.md">this guide</a> on hosting a website using GitHub pages.  This will get you a real, public website that anyone in the world can go to!  You'll need to show me this website as proof of completion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Familiarize yourself with the resources on <a href="https://github.com/nzufelt/intro_html_css">this page</a>&mdash;they will come in super handy!  Perhaps consider bookmarking it.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>


      <strong>Saturday, July 7th</strong>: Web Development I
      <ol>
        <li>
          Read through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">this tutorial page on basic CSS</a>.  This website is W3 Schools (as in <code>www</code>, or <em>world wide web</em>), and it is going to have answers to almost all of your questions!  Be sure to read through the linked page (CSS Introduction), as well as the next page, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">CSS Syntax</a>.  Be sure to click and interact with the examples, especially the "multiple style sheets" example on the first page.  <strong>Complete the 4 exercises on the bottom of the CSS Syntax page.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your edited HTML code from our website (from today's class), or re-download the HTML code from our website by navigating to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nzufelt/ace10_summer2018/master/index.html">this page</a>, then put that file <em>in your git repository</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, the folder that you use to push code up to your website).  You'll need to give it a different name than <code>index.html</code>, but it still needs to be like: <code>something_without_spaces.html</code>.  Try to add a link to it from your portfolio under the "other" section, and see if it works.  If not, no worries, we'll fix that tomorrow.  Make sure you get to:
        </li>
        <li>
          Style your version of our website!  The best styles (determined by all of us) will be the version(s) of our real website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feel free to get started with Human Resource Machine!
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>


      <strong>Monday, July 9th</strong>: Web Development II
      <ol>
        <li>
          Work through <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">this problem set on flexbox</a>.  This <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">guide to flexbox</a> should be handy&mdash;bookmark it!  Here is <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4GaHn08BXQw">the video</a> we watched in class, in case you'd like another view.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start your <a href="project/project1.html">project</a>!  Be sure to come with lots of questions on Monday.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On our quiz Monday:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML (everything we did on the HTML worksheet),
            </li>
            <li>
              Basic filesystem navigation (Things like "which commands should I type to go up two directories, into a subdirectory, then make a directory?"), and
            </li>
            <li>
              Some <em>basic</em> CSS selectors (Things like "how do I select all the <code>p</code>'s inside of a <code>div</code>?")
            </li>
          </ul>
          The best way to prepare is to just practice, practice, practice all of these things (by making your website, or making your own codepens, or anything!)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>

      <strong>Tuesday, July 17th</strong>: JavaScript and the DOM
      <ol>
        <li>
          Read through each of these webpages on w3schools and do the exercises at the end.  This makes for <strong>8 total</strong> exercises!
          <ul>
            <li>
