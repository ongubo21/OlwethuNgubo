<p class=paragraph>Artificial intelligence is rapidly developing, it can be used for a lot of different purposes that can be beneficial
       to our world. Unfortunately, it is mostly used for the benefit of big companies and successful businessmen.</p>

<p class=paragraph>On her video Zeynep Tufekci talks about how companies use artificial intelligence for advertising.
She says that companies like Facebook and Google collect data based on who you are friends with,
your search history or what you are generally interested in and decide what advertisements they want to show you.
YouTube is not any different, it uses bots to keep track of your watch history on the app and then suggest videos they
think you would be interested in based on that and they also figure out which products to advertise to you.
All of that happens within milliseconds.Companies like that go through big measure to
<a href="http://nprillinois.org/post/our-mental-space-under-attack#stream/0">capture and keep our attention</a></p>

<p class=paragraph>It would be fine if that was where it ended, if that was the limit for those algorithms everything would be perfect,
It would be fine if that was where it ended, if that was the limit for those algorithms everything would be perfect,
it is actually very convenient to not have to find videos you are interested in on YouTube, it is pretty great to have
things you would want to buy urging you to buy them. Unfortunately, this advertising industry has no limits,
according to Zeynep, these algorithms have the ability to keep track of your data on Facebook and manipulate your views
by changing what you see on your feed and displaying things that might evoke emotions,
it shows all the stuff that you might be affected by and it buries everything else underneath.</p>
<p class=paragraph>
Apparently, it can also identify the sexual orientation of a person by just looking at their profile picture on dating sites.
What is worse is that these algorithms mess with the lives of people. Advertising can go from something as simple or as
innocent as placing candy bars next to cashiers so that the kids can see them as their parents are checking out and
nag them to buying extra junk, driving people deeper into their mental instabilities. They use data collected and sold to
them by social media sited such as Facebook which helps them identify people who are not in good mental spaces and make
them do stuff they would not do as their normal selves, basically they have said goodbye to old advertising methods of
targeting certain audiences for their products to manipulating people who are not well mentally.</p>

<p class=paragraph>Bipolar people or people who are going through difficult times or phases in their lives are targeted by algorithms
because people like this are more likely to overspend or buy stuff they would not usually buy normally. Good thing is
that these algorithms are based on probability rather than fact son they are not 100% correct or reliable, but who is
to say that wealthy businessmen and big companies would not use things that would benefit them if it has a probability
of working out even if they have a small chance at being successful.
