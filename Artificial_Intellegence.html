<h1><strong>Artificial Intellegence</strong></h1>

  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>Artificial intelligence is both a good and a bad thing. For one thing, it shows the intelligence of the human minds that make these  machines that are artificially intelligent, it makes the lives of humans so much easier to have such machines, humans are required to do a lot less work than they usually do because of those machines.

On the other hand, those robots can be extremely lethal. Morally,  something that mimics or shows a sign of human behavior should never  be made by humans. Yes, all these robots are just  machines, very smart machines, but machines nevertheless and they aren't really capable of causing much harm, but who is to say that these creations wouldn't be developed by the creators to be almost exactly like humans. Now, that might sound far-fetched, but nobody is to say it is impossible

    <p>The issue of these machines taking over people's jobs is bizarre, I understand the simple manual-labor jobs. I don't condone,  because having machines take over those would have lots of people lose their jobs. Businessmen would realize that maintaining machines cost a lot less than having workers, then the businessmen earn a lot of money without paying a lot, but on the other hand workers lose their jobs. Which will cause the gap between the rich and the poor to grow larger.

Now the case of machines taking over honorable positions like doctors and lawyers is atrocious. I wouldn't want to be doctored by a machine no matter how much they  are less likely to make a mistake, I would never feel comfortable with my health being in the hands of a machine. Even with the lawyers,  being a lawyer is not just collecting information and presenting it to the courts. It requires some level of manipulation, some level of tricks and mind-games when presenting a court case These simply cannot be articulated or man-made, they are solid to the human brain and cannot be transported.

    <p> Some good can come from artificial intelligence though; automobiles. Automobiles  are a lot safer than cars and even though lots of people could lose their jobs, lots of lives could be saved. .</p>
